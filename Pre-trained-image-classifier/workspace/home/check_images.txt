4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: Both alexnet and resnet are good architectures . i have decided this based on the incorrect breed selection which is reported from thevgg CNN. And i prefer alexnet more as it is giving accurate results and total elapse time compared to resnet is leser for alexnet and hence accurate results in less time gives us a good model so i prefer "alexnet".although this is quite unstable decision as both great swiss mountain and ectlebucher are very alike.
